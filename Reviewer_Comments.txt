Comments from Editor:
The reference list is extremely lean. The paper should
include more relevant (travel time estimation, travel time
distribution estimation) recent literature. 


Comments from Reviewer 1:
The paper presents an algorithm to predict the travel times
on a motorway given the training data could have spikes.
The paper is interesting especially from the practical
point of view and it could be of interest to road
practitioners.

The paper could be improved by:
1- providing some more clarification on the seasonality
terms, which I could not undrestand what they exactly are
demonstrating.

2- Providing some limitations of the algorithm and expected
accuracy of the predictions and duration of predictions
that we can expect those accuracy. 

3- I am still not confident the algorithm of the paper can
be applied in practice for proactive road operations, or
accident event detections. Please elaborate on this.


Comments from Reviewer 2:
The paper presents the estimation of travel time based on
an algorithm using steps that have heuristics involved. 
The algorithm is not developed in a methodical way.  The
travel time concept is not discussed or even presented in a
scientific way.  The paper dives into a case study right
from the start rather than first developing and discussing
"travel time" and what is involved in its relationship to
the various variables used. 


Comments from Reviewer 3:
The structure of the manuscript looks like a report rather
than a scientific paper. There is a rich literature on
travel time estimation methods which obviously the authors
ignored in this paper. For the revised version please do
the following:
1. Restructure the paper (first clarify the contribution by
referring to the existing works in the literature).
2. Present your approach clearly
3. Compare with few existing methods.
4. Elaborate the results in a comprehensive way.

The contribution of this work is not that clear to the
reader.
